There was something wrong with M33 catalog file (minor) and thus maybe also something wrong with catalog_inc files. Here I was trying to generate a catalog file for only those with light curves, based on what tableB will be generated.

If tableB is very different from previous tableB, then the simulated Mira light curves should be remake.

If remake the simulated Mira light curve, it is a time to get rid of those with reflection, and all use the new C++ code.
