These simulated light curves will not be used. Because:

  The constant light curve templates come from .ALF files, and the zero points between frames were derived separately from TRIALP.F program. As a result, there might be differences about zero points.

  The uncertainties from .ALF files are different from those in the light curve files generated by the TRIALP.F program. Uncertainty of zero points between frames, sigma multipliers may lead to these differences.

To make consistant, we will generate constant light curves from TRIALP.F, and then simulate constant light curves.
