For simulated Mira: Compute the spectra for all with L not being NA. Around 100,000.
For simulated SRV: Compute the spectra for all with L not being NA. Around 100,000.
For simulated Constant: Compute the spectra for those with L>0.6. Around 40,000.

------------ These will not be used for now -----------------------------
For m33var: Compute the spectra for those with L>0.6. Around 80,697.
For m33dupvar: Added on Feb 24, 2016. Those are duplicate light curves. Considered as var if at least one of the light curve has L>0.6. Around 7275.
