This step involved the following tasks:

(1) Match the new I-band light curves to Pellerin's catalog, retrieve the RA, Dec, etc.
    output: m33var_raw_cat.dat, m33con_raw_cat.dat
    sid         ra         dec    imag     ierr   vmag    verr    bmag    berr    vid     bid

(2) Use the RA, Dec information, match the i-band .fnl file to Massey's M33 photometry catalog to derive the zero point of i-only type magnitude.
    One need to retrieve all their I-band instrumental magnitude from .fnl file.
    dI = dI_0
    To derive dI, use constant stars to match, and apply the results to both constant stars and variable stars which have not been calibrated (vmag = -1).
    

(3) Combine duplicate light curves. There are some stars have multiple light curves since they appears in different frames. The previous dup.dat from Dr. Pellerin seems difficult to recover (and not complete). We will check duplicates based on RA and Dec.
    Duplicate light curves will be recorded in a different file. The new light curves will be generated based on the duplicate record. We need to consider constant and variable as whole to check duplicates.
    New light curves will be saved in dir/dup_constant dup_variable  (parallel to constant and variable)
    Combine light curve with at least 1 variable type will be considered as dup_variable, otherwise dup_constant
