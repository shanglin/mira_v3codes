Make the simulation for constant stars. The templates include both true light curves of both L < 0.6 and L > 0.6, so all the junk files is included.
Real light curve come from TRIALP programe.
MJDs are shuffled, and selected from all available (good) MJDs. The propotion of each MJD is kept when random sampling.
