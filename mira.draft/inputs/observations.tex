\section{Observations and Photometry of M33} \label{sec.observations}

The detailed descriptions of observations and photometry procedures can be found in the first paper of the series \citep{2011ApJS..193...26P}. Here we briefly summarize them.

Almost the entire disk of M33, which spans approximately half square degree in the sky \citep{1895MNRAS..56...70R}, was observed by the DIRECT project and follow-up observations. The original DIRECT project used the Fred L. Whipple Observatory 1.2m telescope and the Michigan-Darmouth-MIT 1.3m telescope to observe M33 during 1996 September to 1999 Novemeber. Addtional observations was obtained at the Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-NOAO Observatory 3.5m telescope between 2002 August to 2006 August. In this paper we refer them collectively as M33 observations. We only used the $I$-band data to search for Miras. The number of $I$-band observations for individual objects is shown in Figure~\ref{fig.n_obs}. It is common that there is more than one observations in one night, and as a result the median number of nights with observations is around 30. The observations consists of 29 fields, and different fields have different distributions of number of observations.

We used the photometry products from \cite{2011ApJS..193...26P}. They performed PSF photometry using the DAOPHOT, ALLSTAR, and ALLFRAME \citep{1987PASP...99..191S,1994PASP..106..250S}, and carried out photometric calibration based on \cite{2006AJ....131.2478M}. We used the $I$-band light curves with Stetson's variability index $J>0.75$ \citep{1996PASP..108..851S} to carry out Mira search.
