\section{Observations and Photometry of M33} \label{sec.observations}

The detailed descriptions of observations and photometry procedures can be found in the first paper of the series \citep{2011ApJS..193...26P}. Here we briefly summarize them.

Almost the entire disk of M33, which spans approximately half square degree in the sky \citep{1895MNRAS..56...70R}, was observed by the DIRECT project and follow-up observations. The original DIRECT project used the Fred L. Whipple Observatory 1.2m telescope and the Michigan-Darmouth-MIT 1.3m telescope to observe M33 during 1996 September to 1999 Novemeber. Addtional observations was obtained at the Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-NOAO Observatory 3.5m telescope between 2002 August to 2006 August. In the following context we refer them collectively as M33 observations. In this study we only used the $I$-band data to search for Miras. The number of $I$-band observations for individual objects is shown in Figure~\ref{fig.n_obs}. It is common that there is more than one observations in one night, and as a result the median number of nights with observations is around 30.
