\section{Models} \label{sec.models}

\subsection{simulations}
1. lmc mira to M33

2. constant + gaussian noise from sigma-mag relation

3. constant + under-estimated gaussian noise 

4. constant + gaussian noise from sigma-mag relation + few obnormal

points (bad pixels, cosmic rays, blending, numeric failure, mismatch,
image boundary)

5. eclipsing, nova, SRV, irregular variable


1-5 light curves --> Stetson's J > 0.75 --> Simulated data set

Apply GP on simulated data set

\subsection{model 1}
Regression (ridge, lasso ?)

\subsection{model 2}
Beyes, cart, svm?

\subsection{model 3}
Deep learning?
