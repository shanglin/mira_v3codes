We have applied the newly developed semi-parametric periodogrom (\red{Citation Coming Soon}) on M33 optical observation to search for Miras. We developed M33 data specific models to calculate the probabilities of being Mira for all possible targets. The training data set was constructed by simulating the M33 Mira light curves with known periods and non-Mira light curves in order to train our models. We found \red{XXX} Mira candiates, with a \red{XX}\% discovery rate and \red{XX}\% purity, which are estimated from the training data set. We tentatively classified the Oxygen-rich and Carbon-rich Miras and give their Period-Luminosity relations.
