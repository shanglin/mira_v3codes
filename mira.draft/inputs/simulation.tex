\section{Simulation of M33 observations} \label{sec.simulation}

1. lmc mira to M33

2. constant + gaussian noise from sigma-mag relation

3. constant + under-estimated gaussian noise 

4. constant + gaussian noise from sigma-mag relation + few obnormal

points (bad pixels, cosmic rays, blending, numeric failure, mismatch,
image boundary)

5. eclipsing, nova, SRV, irregular variable
